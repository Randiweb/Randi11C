<center><h1><i>Billboard’s Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century: No. 21 — Lil Wayne</i></h1></center>

<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\21_Lil-Wayne_embed_hero-greatest-pop-stars-billboard-1548.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center><br>

<li><font size="5">Born:Dwayne Michael Carter Jr. · September 27, 1982 · New Orleans, Louisiana, U.S.</li>
<li>Education:University of Phoenix</li>
<li>Spouse:Toya Johnson · (m. 2004; div. 2006)</li>
<li>Children:4</font></li>


<p><font size="5">Once Wayne invaded the “Best Rapper Alive” discussion in the mid-’00s, he began cementing his status as a commercial titan even beyond hip-hop. Everyone from Enrique Iglesias to Shakira wanted a piece of Weezy, whose grill-bearing smile became unavoidable in pop culture and led to him defining an era of hip-hop during a time where rap essentially became interchangeable with pop, on its way to emerging as music’s most-consumed genre. Oh, and he introduced the world to Drake and Nicki Minaj under his Young Money imprint, who would go on to be even more dominant than him within pop music in the decade to follow. 

Long before his mixtape supremacy, lighter flicks and Bape camouflage, Weezy got his feet wet establishing himself as a prodigy in the Cash Money Records army and the youngest member of the Hot Boys. Wayne finished the 20th century on a high note — and proved ready to take over for the 2000s as just a 16-year-old — with appearances on a pair of lexicon-expanding classics, when he had the country hollering “Bling Bling” on B.G.’s diamond-inspired hit, and dropped it like it’s hot on Juvenile’s “Back That Azz Up” anthem.<br>

It was Lil Wayne’s turn to step into the solo spotlight with his raw Tha Block Is Hot debut in late ‘99, which peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and spawned a Hot 100 hit with the title track, assisted by the aforementioned Hot Boys, B.G. and Juvenile. After his next two albums delivered middling commercial performance, Lil Wayne went back to the drawing board – and threw his notepad in the trash after learning Jay-Z was freestyling, which led to the birth of the series that defined Weezy’s career.

It was actually Cash Money sonic savant Mannie Fresh who possessed the foresight to predict that Tha Carter series would go on to live in rap lore as one of the paramount series in the genre’s history. “I’m like, ‘Tha Carter is going to define rap for a while.’ Wayne was like, ‘You really think?’ I’m like, ‘I really do. It’s got to be something incredible,” Mannie Fresh recalled to Complex.<br>

MF broke out the Roland TR-808 drum machine and got Weezy high on his supply. Inspired by ‘90s Cash Money Records group U.N.L.V.’s shout-out to the in-house producer, Wayne carried the baton with “Go DJ.” The spacey track cracked the Hot 100’s top 15, proving he could carry a major hit on his own. The pop world also began to take notice of Weezy’s shooting stardom, as Destiny’s Child enlisted Lil Wayne and then-consensus King of the South T.I. to mobilize for top five Hot 100 hit “Soldier,” which was nominated for best rap/sung collaboration at the 2005 Grammys.<br>

There wasn’t a minute to be wasted in the time between Tha Carter II to C3, with Wayne climbing higher into rap’s pantheon. Weezy became a machine, churning out cheeky punchlines and Auto-Tune-laced rhymes and seemingly never running out of fuel. He painted vivid pictures of heartbreaking love stories and grimy street tales like a chameleon, disappearing into his songs’ canvases.

During this time, he proved himself in the mixtape circuit – unleashing fan-favorite classics like the DJ Drama-hosted Dedication 2 and Da Drought 3, which fortified his legend among the underground hip-hop heads. The cultural impact of Wayne’s mixtapes run is essentially incalculable, since the Billboard charts didn’t account for DatPiff downloads and circulating Limewire files, but many of the tracks live on in iTunes libraries and the hearts of fans as holy grails of that Weezy period. 

Meanwhile, if an artist needed a guest verse in the second half of the ‘00s, there was only one rapper to call. Wayne sprinkled his syrupy flows onto myriad top 40 Hot 100 hits from ‘06 to C3’s arrival in June ‘08, like Chris Brown’s “Gimme That,” Lloyd’s “You,” Fat Joe’s “Make It Rain,” DJ Khaled’s “We Takin Over,” Wyclef Jean’s “Sweetest Girl,” Playaz Circle’s “Duffle Bag Boy,” Birdman’s “Pop Bottles” and Usher’s “Love in This Club Part II.” In the midst of his run, Weezy also teamed up with his mentor Birdman for their Like Father, Like Son joint project, as he became totally unavoidable both on radio and on video networks MTV and BET. </font></p>

<center><h1><i>Billboard’s Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century: No. 22 — One Direction</i></h1></center>

<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\25_One_Direction_hero-billboard-1548.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center><br>


<li><font size="5">Origin:London, England</li>
<li>Genres:Pop · pop rock</li>
<li>Discography:One Direction discography</font></li>

<p><font size="5">As the boys spent more time together, their roles became clearer: Liam Payne, with his standout audition, would be the leader; Louis Tomlinson’s charm would make him the lovable prankster; Niall Horan, the humble boy from Ireland, would be the down-to-earth sweetheart; Zayn Malik, reserved with undeniably striking looks, would be the mysterious one; and Harry Styles, with his curly locks, dimples and wide smile, would be the heartthrob. Together, they were 1D, and they would take over the world.<br>
One Direction’s ascent to global stardom proved that the boy band archetype could still thrive in the 21st century, albeit in a new and distinctly modern way. In just five years, 1D released five albums that brought uptempo British pop-rock to the States and laid the foundation for today’s international pop groups. A new online community, “stan Twitter,” rallied around the group, and their superfans, called “Directioners,” helped their idols achieve astronomical mainstream success, changing fan-to-fan communication and fan-to-artist relationships forever.

Back in 2011, One Direction won the hearts of The X Factor’s U.K. audience with a mix of pop covers ranging from Coldplay’s “Viva la Vida” to Snow Patrol’s “Chasing Cars” — and even though they didn’t win the competition, they won something bigger: an already devout fan following, and a contract with Simon Cowell’s Syco Records. Cowell moved swiftly to capitalize on One Direction’s momentum, pairing the group with established hit-makers to churn out its debut single, “What Makes You Beautiful.” Savan Kotecha, whose writing credits already included songs for Britney Spears, Katy Perry and Usher, penned the track and perfected it with the help of fellow writer Carl Falk, who would go on to write for Ariana Grande, Jason Derulo and Madonna.<br>

One Direction had a je ne sais quoi that set it apart from other boy bands. Unlike most of their predecessors, the five members didn’t follow choreography or dress alike, but they still possessed the same level of charisma — just in different packages. Their distinct personalities shone in interviews, video diaries and Twitter Q&As, and even more so when they interacted with one another. Watching five young men come together like brothers to live out their dreams was inspiring, and their camaraderie warmed the hearts of millions. The fans treasured the group’s relationships so deeply that they declared allegiance to every possible combination of inter-band dynamics, including “Narry,” “LiLo” and “Ziam.”<br>


<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\25_One_Direction_embed_1-billboard-1240.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center><br>


Directioners wanted more — and they got what they wished for. A Pepsi Super Bowl Halftime commercial with NFL star Drew Brees aired, guest appearances on iCarly and SNL premiered on the same day in April, and the quintet took the stage at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games. You couldn’t walk into a drugstore without encountering a One Direction toothbrush or turn on the radio without hearing “What Makes You Beautiful” — it was Beatlemania for the 2010s, powered by fans who were online 24/7, 365 days a year and watching the quintet’s every move — sometimes going as far as hacking security cameras in elevators and airports just to catch a glimpse of their favorite band. 

The release of One Direction’s sophomore album, Take Me Home, ushered in a new era: The set also debuted atop the Billboard 200, making One Direction the first act to best the chart with its first two albums since American girl group Danity Kane, and 1D became the first boy band in U.S. chart history to land two No. 1 albums in a calendar year. But the accolades were not as significant to the members as how the release helped them evolve their image. Each had writing credits on this album, showing that they were involved artists who had control of the development of their music, and bolder, more blatantly suggestive lyrics on songs like “Live While We’re Young” and fan favorite “Rock Me” reminded their audience that despite their Radio Disney-friendly appeal, the members were all young adults by then, ranging from 18 to 20 years old. While critics were not convinced that One Direction could shake its bubblegum pop sound, fans loved it, and the Take Me Home tour was the band’s biggest yet, wrapping with an accompanying concert film.. </font></p>

<center><h1><i>Billboard’s Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century: No. 23 — Bad Bunny</i></h1></center>

<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\25_Bad_Bunny_hero-greatest-pop-stars-billboard-1548.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center><br>

<li><font size="5">Born:Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio · March 10, 1994 · Vega Baja, Puerto Rico</li>
<li>Labels:Hear This Music · Rimas</li>
<li>Occupations:Rapper · singer · songwriter · record producer · actor · professional wrestler</li>
<li>Years active:2013–present</font></li>

<p><font size="5">Over the next year, Bad Bunny would also become a fixture on the Hot 100, appearing on hits alongside Becky G (“Mayores”) and Enrique Iglesias (“El Baño”), while also contributing his growing star power to All-Star cuts like “Krippy Kush” and “Te Boté,” the latter his first top 40 entry on the chart. While Bad Bunny was just one artist of many on the latter two songs – with a combined 10 total credited names between them – he stood out for both his distinctive voice, a congested-but-buttery croon which also made his trademark artist tag (“Bad Bunny bay-beh!!”) instantly unforgettable, and for his impeccable fashion style, an unconventional mix of the flamboyant and the basic that always seemed to land within the realm of timeless cool.<br>
It all led up to his 2018 feature appearance on American rap superstar Cardi B’s “I Like It,” one of pop’s great star-making moments of the 21st century. While Bad Bunny did not yet have the household name recognition of either Cardi or fellow guest reggaetonero J Balvin – who’d recently scored a massive U.S. crossover moment of his own with the Willy William collab “Mi Gente,” even landing Beyoncé for the song’s remix – his verse still kinda stole the show, from its opening “chambea, chambea” chant. Wearing cat-eye sunglasses and a Puerto Rico World Baseball Classic jersey in the song’s hugely popular music video, Ocasio already looked like an icon in the making. The song reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, and ensured that all eyes everywhere were now on Bad Bunny. <br>

The heat from “I Like It” did not take long to translate to Bad Bunny’s career as a leading man. Just a few months later, he returned with “MIA,” which landed a guest verse from perhaps the only hitmaker with even more juice than Cardi B in 2018: Drake, in the midst of a year where he’d spend a combined 29 weeks atop the Hot 100 with Scorpion singles “God’s Plan,” “Nice for What” and “In My Feelings.” Not only did the Canadian-born superstar play the hook man for Bad Bunny’s new single, he actually sang in Spanish for it – showing that this early in his rise, Benito already had the clout to get the English-speaking pop world to come to his turf. “MIA” was another enormous success for Bad Bunny, reaching No. 5 on the Hot 100 and enduring for long enough to end up the No. 1 year-end single on the 2019 Year-End Hot Latin Songs chart.<br>

Amazingly, Bad Bunny’s entire rise to stardom transpired before he even released his debut album. That came at the tail end of 2018, however, with X 100pre. Rather than cash in on his two years of hits and big-name collabs to that point, Bad Bunny’s debut album featured only a couple of his previously released singles and just a few guests, with “MIA” stuck at the end like a bonus track. The album drew rave reviews and reached No. 11 on the Billboard 200, hanging around the chart well into the next decade and ultimately spending 177 weeks on the listing, confirming that Bad Bunny was already much more than just a singles artist. 

<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\25_Bad_Bunny_embed_1-greatest-pop-stars-billboard-1240.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center><br>


In June 2019, while Bad Bunny was still spinning off X 100pre hits, having further success with singles alongside hitmakers Tainy (“Callaíta”), Lunay (“Soltera”) and Jhayco (“No Me Conoces”) and taking a break in between legs of his first arena tour, Bad Bunny would further electrify his now-global audience by reteaming with his “I Like It” collaborator J Balvin for the Oasis EP. Despite having just eight tracks, the set made both the top 10 on the Billboard 200 and the top 10 of Billboard’s year-end staff albums list for 2019. Perhaps most importantly, while Bad Bunny was unquestionably the little brother of the two from a star perspective on “I Like It” just a year earlier, by the time of Oasis he and Balvin were clearly on even footing as the two leading hitmakers in reggaetón and Latin trap. <br>

But while Balvin’s stateside star would fade somewhat as the decade turned to the 2020s, Bad Bunny’s would only get brighter. In 2020 alone he would release a trio of albums – YHLQMDLG (short for Yo Hago Lo Que Me Da La Gana, “I Do Whatever I Want” in English) in February, castoffs compilation Las Que No Iban a Salir (The Ones That Were Not Coming Out) in May and El Último Tour del Mundo (The Last Tour in the World) in November – that continued to expand his sound and his global profile, attracting rave reviews (even from many listeners and publications who had not traditionally shown interest in Latin pop or reggaetón). His albums became event releases – doubly so because he started scheduling them around major calendar events (X 100pre on Christmas Eve, YHLQMDLG on Leap Day, El Último on Thanksgiving, etc.) What’s more, in December, Último made history by debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, marking not only Bad Bunny’s first appearance atop the chart, but the first entirely Spanish-language No. 1 album in the chart’s then-64-year existence. </font></p>

<center><h1><i>Billboard’s Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century: No. 24 — Ed Sheeran</i></h1></center>

<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\greatest-pop-stars-25-ed-sheeran-2024-billboard-1548.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center><br>

<li><font size="5">Born:Edward Christopher Sheeran · 17 February 1991 · Halifax, West Yorkshire, England</li>
<li>Spouse:Cherry Seaborn (m. 2019)</li>
<li>Children:2</li>
<li>Instruments:Vocals · guitar</font></li>


<p><font size="5">A single person, playing the guitar alone on stage in the middle of a stadium. It’s a fantasy — being an artist whose music and lyrics are simply so undeniable, so unifying, that they leap from the meekest clubs to the most gargantuan venues in the world! — that countless singer-songwriters from all walks of life have attempted to strum into reality over the past 25 years, and almost every single one has come up short. It’s the wrong instrument for this century, really: modern pop does not function like it did back when rock ’n roll was the dominant sound, so this Greatest Pop Stars list does not include a slew of six-string-toting chart-toppers.<br>
With that in mind, the scale of Ed Sheeran’s 21st century success is even more impressive. In a pop age where singer-songwriters generally bump against their commercial ceiling relatively early in their evolution, this red-headed kid from Halifax kept soaring higher and higher, eventually reaching a space where his longevity, global appeal, influence and multi-quadrant hits allowed him to stand alone. He used to be a teen busking on the streets of London; now, Sheeran often finds himself in the center of 80,000 people, an acoustic strapped to his shoulder, no one and nothing else in his vicinity. And considering everything he’s done, he doesn’t even look that out of place.<br>

<center><a href="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\watch (13).htm">Click here to watch this song<a></center><br>


Unlike hitmakers such as John Mayer, Jason Mraz and Gavin DeGraw — singer-songwriters who burst onto the scene in the 2000s with flashy, radio-friendly pop singles — Sheeran began his journey into the spotlight with a quiet, unassuming breakthrough hit. Following years of independent releases in between street performances and open-mic nights across the U.K., Sheeran chose “The A Team,” a pleading folk ballad about a sex worker addicted to drugs, as his debut single in 2011 – betting on its juxtaposition of finger-picked melodies and a soothing vocal tone with dark subject matter and stripped-down production.

The bet paid off: In the heart of the EDM-fueled, turbo-pop assault at the top of the Billboard Hot 100, the minimalist sing-along of “The A Team” counteracted the spastic movement of concurrent megapop hits by LMFAO and Pitbull. There had been no shortage of hushed, bleeding-heart singer-songwriter fare that had found its way to adult pop listeners prior to “The A Team” taking off, but Sheeran’s debut was a touch smarter (“A Team” refers to the “Class A drugs” that the song’s subject has taken), more sincere (the way Sheeran warbles “She don’t wanna go-o-o-o outside, tonight” as a major emotional payoff), and altogether more striking than the soundalike songs around it, climbing to No. 3 in Sheeran’s native U.K. and to No. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100.<BR>


<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\greatest-pop-stars-25-ed-sheeran-2024-billboard-3-1240.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center><br>


Beyond its chart peaks, “The A Team” introduced Sheeran as an early-twenties troubadour worth investing in long-term. He played the song on late-night talk shows, and later at the Grammys, where it was nominated for song of the year. Sheeran’s debut studio album, +, arrived a few months later in 2011, scoring a respectable No. 5 debut on the Billboard 200. And while third single “Lego House” replicated the gentle guitar-pop formula of “The A Team” (with a Rupert Grint-starring music video, as a play on the Harry Potter actor’s physical resemblance to Sheeran), in between, “You Need Me, I Don’t Need You” shook up Sheeran’s image as a hip-hop-adjacent music industry shrug-off, with the singer-songwriter rapping over drum loops, guitar and piano. The song never reached the Hot 100, but became a live staple and fan favorite; more importantly, “You Need Me” expanded expectations for what an Ed Sheeran song could sound like as his voice was reaching wider audiences.

Soon enough, those wider audiences would include Taylor Swift — a country superstar yet to fully cross over to pop in the early 2010s. Swift tapped Sheeran for the Red duet “Everything Has Changed,” which became a top 40 Hot 100 hit as one of the album’s later singles, then brought him on the road as the opening act on the Red arena tour. Swift’s co-sign was and remains a crucial stamp of approval for aspiring artists, but she went above and beyond as an early Sheeran supporter; the two remain close friends and collaborators more than a decade later, having recently re-recorded “Everything Has Changed” for Swift’s mega-selling Red (Taylor’s Version).</font></p>

<center><h1><i>Billboard’s Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century: No. 25 — Katy Perry</i></h1></center>

<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\25_Katy_hero_horiz-billboard-1548.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center><br>

<li><font size="5">Born:Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson · October 25, 1984 · Santa Barbara, California, U.S.</li>
<li>Spouse:Russell Brand · (m. 2010; div. 2012)</li>
<li>Partner(s):Orlando Bloom (2016–present; engaged)</li>
<li>Children:1</font></li>


<p><font size="5">For anyone who lived through her commercial peak, Katy Perry will always be one of the names most synonymous with pop music. There’s a lot of reasons for that, but perhaps the biggest is that few performers of the last 25 years have felt as committed to maxing out top 40 superstardom at its biggest, brightest and best: When Katy Perry ruled the mainstream at the turn of the 2010s, it felt like she was wringing every ounce of potential from her albums, singles, videos, live performances, TV appearances, fashion and branding choices and general public persona. It was pop as the most legendary icons of early MTV once envisioned it – and perhaps unsurprisingly, it matched their success in ways no other artist this century has managed. <br>

<center><a href="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\watch (14).htm">Click here to watch this song<a></center><br>


Few would have imagined that fate for Katy Perry when she initially emerged – first briefly in the early ‘00s as Katy Hudson, contemporary Christian artist, and then rebranded as snotty Warped Tour singer-songwriter Katy Perry later in the decade. “Ur So Gay,” the metrosexual-taunting title track to her first Perry-era EP release, suggested great promise for word-of-mouth cult success, but seemed too cheeky, too edgy and too problematic for top 40 success. At the time, the mainstream had been dominated for years by hip-hop, Auto-Tune and post-American Idol pop-rock seriousness; there didn’t seem to be too much of an opening for the kind of technicolor, attitude-driven turbo-pop Perry was bringing to the table.<br>
Ultimately, the noise around “Girl” just ended up pumping up the volume of the song itself, which blazed its way to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in July 2008. By then, parent album One of the Boys had been released, with the major-label debut set entering the Billboard 200’s top 10 and spawning another three hit singles. Two of those were Hot 100 top 10s: the bubbly relationship eye-roller “Hot n Cold,” which was arguably both her rudest and most unstoppable pop-rock blast yet, and the widescreen morning-after anthem “Waking Up in Vegas,” a less-bratty but still delectably post-hedonistic story song. In between them was the more straightforward ballad “Thinking of You,” her first single that sounded like it could’ve been done by one of her then-top 40 peers; the song tapped out at No. 29 on the Hot 100, suggesting audiences preferred Katy Perry at her Katy Perriest. <br>


<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\25_Katy_embed_2-billboard-1240.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center><br>


With the fifth No. 1 off Teenage Dream, the album famously made chart history, as just the second set (after Michael Jackson’s 1987 blockbuster Bad) to ever spawn five Hot 100 No. 1 hits. The achievement capped one of the most successful album rollouts in pop music history, with each single essentially becoming its own mini-universe, given its own sound, look, aesthetic and narrative different from the other four. It also showed Perry and her team to be at the forefront of finding ways to build excitement and consumption for late-cycle singles in the digital age; adding Ye to the single release of “E.T.” and Missy Elliott to the remix of “Last Friday Night” helped get those songs to No. 1 on the Hot 100 years before adding after-the-fact A-listers became standard practice for big pop singles.<br>

And Perry’s ubiquity at the time went far beyond the Billboard record books: For about two years at the beginning of the decade, she was absolutely unavoidable throughout pop culture. She appeared in Proactiv commercials and on Sesame Street, she walked red carpets with star comedian Russell Brand (her then-husband) and sat next to fellow pop megastar Rihanna at award shows, she hosted SNL, she kissed a Smurf and she liked it. She traversed the globe on her kaleidoscopic California Dreams tour, racking up nearly $60 million in box office for just her second headlining trek, according to Billboard Boxscore. She racked up additional honors across the pop culture spectrum, from video of the year (for “Firework”) at the MTV Video Music Awards to most beautiful woman in the world on the Maxim Hot 100. And oh yeah, she also released a Complete Confection deluxe edition of Teenage Dream that spawned another No. 1 in the defiant shout-along “Part of Me” and nearly another still in the No. 2-peaking post-breakup ballad “Wide Awake.”  </font></p>
