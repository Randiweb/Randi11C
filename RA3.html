<p><font size="5">Welcome to Billboard ’s Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century article series! Since late August, we’ve been rolling out our picks for the artists who have most defined pop stardom for the last 25 years – with essays for each artist recapping their careers and explaining why they’ve exemplified pop greatness to us over the period.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">You can find each of those essays here, along with our list of the close-but-not-quite honorable mentions that couldn’t quite crack our top 25, and our podcast discussions of each artist so far. Find it all below, and be sure to head back to this page over the next couple months as we continue to update the list weekly with new essays — and get closer and closer to naming our No. 1 Greatest Pop Star of the 21st Century.</font></p>

<center><h1><i>Billboard’s Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century: No. 9 — Ariana Grande</i></h1></center>

<p><font size="5">With the first quarter of the 21st century coming to a close, Billboard is spending the next few months counting down our staff picks for the 25 greatest pop stars of the last 25 years. You can see the stars who have made our list so far here, and now we remember the century in Ariana Grande — whose standard-defying approach to pop music saw her withstand expectations and stigma to become one of the most prolific examples of what pop sovereignty can look like in the streaming era.</p>

<p>It’s easy to view Ariana Grande’s rise to the highest echelons of pop stardom as a classic, uncomplicated success story within the music business. The child-actor-turned-pop-sensation route is well-trodden, after all, and at first glance, the 31-year-old singer-songwriter appears to be yet another benefactor of that industry pipeline.</p></font><font size="5">

<font size="5">Her foothold in the entertainment industry firmly established, Grande soon landed her breakthrough role as the loveable ditz Cat Valentine on Nickelodeon’s Victorious. With a sing-song voice proclaiming increasingly zany one-liners over the course of the show’s run, the character quickly rose among the ranks of the children’s network’s beloved characters — thanks, especially, to the impressive vocal chops Grande got to occasionally flaunt throughout the three season run. Valentine became so popular among the network’s fans that she earned her own spinoff series with iCarly’s Sam Puckett (Jennette McCurdy) on 2013’s Sam & Cat.</font>

<center><h1><i>Billboard’s Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century: No. 10 — Adele</i></h1></center>

<p><font size="5">With the first quarter of the 21st century coming to a close, Billboard is spending the next few months counting down our staff picks for the 25 greatest pop stars of the last 25 years. You can see the stars who have made our list so far here — and now, we remember the century in Adele, a powerhouse presence and unlikely superstar who emerged from a pop golden age to put up numbers most of her peers could only dream about. </p>

<p>By the year 2010, Adele was already a Grammy-winning global hitmaker, so you couldn’t really say she came out of nowhere. But during a period of pop music that was quintessentially BIG – in sound, in scope, in ambition and in commercial returns – for the biggest artist by a near-exponential magnitude to turn out to be the British singer-songwriter with all the weepy breakup ballads was borderline-unthinkable, even as it was becoming an increasingly obvious reality. And for her to get even bigger from there, until she was putting up stats no other pop phenomenon had achieved before or has matched since – even as the music industry around her was supposedly in failing health – remains dizzying to think about a decade later.
</p></font>

<font size="5">How did she do it? With a singularly mighty voice, an industrial-strength artistic identity, an unexpectedly earthy sense of humor, and of course, a handful of no-doubt five-star pop songs. And somewhat counter-intuitively, also with good timing: Most of early-2010s pop music consisted of futuristic dance-pop jams pushing a pro-partying agenda with a pre-apocalyptic undercurrent, making Adele’s retro-leaning soul-pop a much-needed breath of fresh air. Perhaps more importantly, though, her albums were also simply a breath – stripped-down, emotionally raw sets that invited you to hit pause on the urgency of the present and the anxiety of the future and spend 40-plus minutes in the gentle thrall of an artist tapping into something truly timeless.

<center><h1><i>Billboard’s Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century: No. 11 — Usher</i></h1></center> 

<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\11-usher-gps-hero-2024-billboard-1548.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center>

<li>Born:Usher Raymond IV · October 14, 1978 · Dallas, Texas, U.S.</li>
<li>Children:4</li>
<li>Labels:LaFace · Arista · Jive · RCA · Legacy · RBMG · Mega · Gamma</li>
<li>Member ofOcean's 7</li>

<p><font size="5">Not many artists can say they’ve made the successful transition from teen sensation to adult superstar. It’s an exclusive club whose membership brings to mind all-time greats like Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift… and then there’s Usher, baby: the singing, dancing triple-threat in the Braves hat and the U chain. </font></P>

<p><font size="5">This year, Usher has basically been running on one long career-spanning victory lap, celebrating his 30th anniversary in music and the 20th anniversary of his diamond-certified 2004 classic Confessions, and performing at the Apple Music Super Bowl LVIII Halftime Show in February to the tune of 123 million viewers — the most-watched halftime show ever. And that’s not to say that he’s been stuck in the past either: This February also saw the release of his ninth studio album Coming Home (debuting at No. 2 on the Billboard 200), while in August, he also launched his Past Present Future arena world tour. And all this follows on the heels of Usher’s talk-of-the town My Way – The Vegas Residency that packed both The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in 2021 and the larger Dolby Live at Park MGM a year later – an act he took across the pond with the eight-date Rendez-Vous Á Paris, documented in a concert film released this September. Bottom line: the eight-time Grammy Award winner, who turns 46 on Oct. 14, is riding the wave of one of the most impressive, legacy-cementing comebacks of the last decade.</font></p>

<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\11-usher-gps-embed-1-2024-billboard-1240 (1).webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center>

<font size="5">It’s a multigenerational R&B/pop legacy built on nine Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 singles and 18 top 10 singles plus four Billboard 200 No. 1 albums. The latter streak began with the singer-songwriter’s epic 2004 album Confessions, whose nine weeks at the top led to it being crowned the Year-End Billboard 200’s No. 1 album – the same year that his era-defining “Yeah!” team-up with Lil Jon and Ludacris ended up No. 1 on the Year-End Hot 100. But more significant than the history-making chart stats, sales certifications and industry accolades that Usher has racked up along the way is his innate artistry — a crucial key to his staying power.</font> <hr>

<center><h1><i>Billboard’s Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century: No. 12 — Eminem</i></h1></center>

<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\12_Eminem_embed_hero-greatest-pop-star-billboard-1548.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center>
<li>Born:Marshall Bruce Mathers III · October 17, 1972 · St. Joseph, Missouri, U.S.</li>

<p><font size="5">At the peak of the TRL era in popular music — a turn-of-the-century period dominated by bubbly teen-pop stars and punctuated by furious nu-metal rockers — the biggest artist of all was actually a late-20-something rapper from Detroit. Eminem, who seemingly went from underground battle-rapper to omnipresent superstar by the end of his first week on MTV, reached commercial heights and levels of popular exposure as a solo artist that only the defining stars of pop’s ’80s golden age (and certainly no prior MC) could previously claim.</font></p>

<center><a href="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\watch (6).htm">Click here to watch this song<a></center><br> 


<font size="5">It couldn’t last, and it didn’t — with Em’s run as a culture-defining superstar flaming out sooner than anyone likely would’ve predicted. Eminem himself has lasted, however, remaining a commercial fixture and a high-level rapper since retooling at the turn of the 2010s, rarely quite as central to pop culture as he was during his all-consuming first few years of the century, but always a factor on the charts and in the conversation.</font>

<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\12_Eminem_embed_1-greatest-pop-star-billboard-1240 (1).webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center>

<p><font size="5">By the year 2000, Eminem was already close to a household name, thanks to his breakthrough major-label debut The Slim Shady LP and its lead single “My Name Is.” The wisecracking, s–t-stirring and mercilessly catchy mission statement explicitly introduced him to America as every parent’s worst nightmare — with Em ending the first verse by claiming that God (or, in the song’s radio edit, his iconic producer, label head and mentor Dr. Dre) “sent me to piss the world off.” That breakout hit only reached No. 36 on the Billboard Hot 100, but it made him an immediate MTV sensation with its cartoonishly comedic music video, featuring the artist portraying pop culture figures ranging from shock-rocker Marilyn Manson to impeached president Bill Clinton (and all eight stars of The Shady Bunch).</font></p>

<center><h1><i>Billboard’s Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century: No. 13 — Nicki Minaj</i></h1></center> 

<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\13_Nicki_Minaj_embed_hero-greatest-pop-star-billboard-1548.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center>

<li>Born:Onika Tanya Maraj · December 8, 1982 · Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago</li>
<li>Spouse:Kenneth Petty (m. 2019)</li>
<li>Children:1</li>
<li>LabelsYoung Money · Cash Money · Republic · Heavy On It</li>

<p><font size="5">Though she came to passionately rep Southside Jamaica, Queens (and it’s crazy!) after moving there at the age of five, the artist born Onika Tanya Maraj was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago in 1982. The eldest daughter of four children, Minaj’s birthplace and stomping grounds immediately situate her at the origins of hip-hop, the endlessly influential artform that sprung out of 1970s New York thanks to the city’s rich combination of African-American, Afro-Caribbean and Latin American cultures. And just as so much of hip-hop has grappled (and continues to grapple) with the American dream and its dueling luster and infeasibility, so has Minaj throughout her career — both inside and outside of her music.

Ironically, these two truths align Minaj with traditional markers of hip-hop authenticity: a label that a significant chunk of the world has perceived her as at odds with for most of her career because of the communities – the girls and the gays – she has elected to cater to within hip-hop spaces. Minaj is arguably the single most fascinating MC of her generation; the combination of her razor-sharp wit, undeniable tenacity, irresistible penchant for the provocative and controversial, and, for better and for worse, her undying charisma have resulted in one of the most singular pop star careers of the 21st century.</font> </p>

<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\13_Nicki_Minaj_embed_1-greatest-pop-star-billboard-1240.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center>

<p><font size="5">Shortly after honing her acting skills by way of the storied Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts and a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it Off-Broadway stint, Minaj briefly signed with Brooklyn R&B/hip-hop collective Full Force, through which she rapped as a part of The Hoodstars, a quartet that included her future beau-turned-hypeman-turned-critic, Safaree Samuels. She left the group after five songs – including WWE Diva Victoria’s 2004 entrance song, “Don’t Mess With” — taking to MySpace to begin fine-tuning her approach to social media and the Internet as an artist and get her music to ears of key industry players. One of those players was Dirty Money Entertainment CEO Big Fendi, who signed Minaj to the Brooklyn-based label in 2007, Minaj was signed to a 180-day contract and Fendi fatefully changed her stage name from Nicki Maraj to Nicki Minaj.</font> </p>

<center><h1><i>Billboard’s Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century: No. 14 — Justin Timberlake</i></h1></center>

<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\14_Justin-Timberlake_embed_hero-greatest-pop-star-billboard-1548.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center>

<li>Born:Justin Randall Timberlake · January 31, 1981 · Memphis, Tennessee, U.S.</li>
<li>Education:University of Nebraska High School</li>
<li>Spouse:Jessica Biel (m. 2012)</li>
<li>Children:2</li>

<p><font size="5">Before we arrive at the year 2000, let’s quickly rewind to 12-year-old Timberlake landing a spot on Disney Channel’s All-New Mickey Mouse Club in 1993, where he met kindred pop spirit JC Chasez (and Britney Spears too, but we’ll get to her later). That was of course well before both were selected by Lou Pearlman as two of the five members of a new boy band, designed to recapture the late ’80s/early ’90s fan frenzy around New Kids on the Block, and backed by earworm productions from Swedish pop maestros, including the soon-to-be-legendary Max Martin. While *NSYNC made a huge impression with their 1997 self-titled debut album – spinning off four Billboard Hot 100-charting hits – their arrival was preceded by Pearlman’s other group, Backstreet Boys, and it felt a bit like the junior group was playing catch-up to their pop peers.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">That perception was obliterated when *NSYNC’s new millennium kicked off with the January 2000 release of the top five Hot 100 hit “Bye Bye Bye,” leading up to March’s No Strings Attached – which marked not just their biggest album debut yet, but the biggest album debut of all time, selling an unprecedented 2.4 million copies in its first week (setting a record that held for 15 years, until Adele’s 25); topping the Billboard 200 for eight weeks; and producing the group’s lone Hot 100 No. 1 in “It’s Gonna Be Me.”</font></p>

<center><a href="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\watch (8).htm">Click here to watch this song<a></center><br> 



<p><font size="5">One giant album led to another, with *NSYNC returning the next year with 2001’s Celebrity, their second Billboard 200 No. 1, which saw Timberlake’s introduction as the group’s true star. While Timberlake and Chasez had shared lead vocals on every song to that point, there was a solo showcase on Celebrity that painted the picture of what was to come: “Gone” found JT – who traded his famous ramen-noodle curls for a bad-boy buzzcut – singing every verse (showing off his vocal range, from a gravelly baritone to a floating falsetto) and starring front and center in the black-and-white music video, backed by his groupmates for lush harmonies on the chorus. Another sign of Timberlake’s future: Celebrity’s breakout hit “Girlfriend,” *NSYNC’s first foray into hip-hop-flavored pop and a Hot 100 top five hit, included a guest verse from Nelly and production by The Neptunes, foreshadowing the core sound JT would pursue on his solo debut.</font></p>

<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\14_Justin-Timberlake_embed_2-billboard-1240.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center>

<p><font size="5">And we can’t paint a picture of just how massive a star Timberlake was at this point without talking about the power couple that catapulted his public profile into another stratosphere. Timberlake started dating Spears, his fellow Mickey Mouse Club alum, in 1999, and their combined pop powers launched a thousand teen-magazine covers (and led to an iconically bizarre dual-denim fever dream of a red-carpet appearance at the 2001 American Music Awards).</font></p><hr>


<center><h1><i>Billboard’s Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century: No. 15 — Miley Cyrus</i></h1></center>
<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\15-Miley-Cyrus-greatest-pop-stars-hero-2024-billboard-1548.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center>
<li>Born:Destiny Hope Cyrus · November 23, 1992 · Franklin, Tennessee, US</li>
<li>Spouse:Liam Hemsworth · (m. 2018; div. · 2020)</li>
<li>Parents:Billy Ray Cyrus (father) · Tish Cyrus (mother)</li>
<li>Relatives:Ron Cyrus (grandfather) · Trace Cyrus (brother) · Noah Cyrus (sister) · Brandi Cyrus (sister)</li>


<p><font size="5">After debuting as fictional superstar Hannah Montana in the mid-'00s, Miley Cyrus became an IRL pop icon -- delighting, shocking and evolving with her fanbase over the last two decades.For many artists, it’s their hit songs, pop culture-defining albums or chart successes that are easiest to pinpoint as landmarks for the most pivotal stages of their careers. But for Miley Cyrus, it’s hair. Though she certainly has plenty of all the above accomplishments, the 31-year-old generational talent’s phases of life have always been irrevocably intertwined with what’s going on atop her head — from the blonde wig that made her famous in the mid 2000s to the bleached pixie cut that introduced the world to a very different Miley in 2012. It goes beyond the public’s obsession with beauty standards, which a thin, blue-eyed Cyrus would embody for the first several years of her career before rejecting that mold altogether; the singer’s hair has had a way of symbolizing where she’s at personally and artistically over the years.   

<center><a href="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\watch (9).htm">Click here to watch this song<a></center><br> 

And where she’s been, in both regards, has been all over the map. From eager Disney Channel prodigy to unruly pop outlaw, freewheeling genre experimenter and mature modern hitmaker, Cyrus’ knack for earnest reinvention has sustained her through all the peaks and valleys of her career. With no shortage of chart hits and even more iconic culture-shocking moments, she’s endured as one of the century’s most significant pop stars – because no matter what style she’s trying out, at the end of the day, she’s always still just being Miley. 

Born Destiny Hope Cyrus on Nov. 23, 1992, in the Nashville metropolitan area of Tennessee, the most recognizable head of hair in the young star’s childhood wasn’t her own, but father Billy Ray’s signature mullet. Miley, who legally adopted her childhood nickname in 2008, grew up in a constellation of other stars before she would become one herself, with her dad becoming a country sensation in the ’90s for the massive crossover hit “Achy Breaky Heart” and her godmother being none other than Dolly Parton.</font></p>

<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\15-Miley-Cyrus-greatest-pop-stars-05-2024-billboard-1240.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center>

<p><font size="5">Cyrus has already lived multiple lives in her nearly-two-decade career — from tween idol to pop rabble-rouser to rock star and everything else in between – but now, the label that suits Miley best at age 31 is simply seasoned professional. Her versatile talents are sought out by many in the industry, from Beyoncé on Cowboy Carter duet “II Most Wanted” to acclaimed indie studio A24 on a recent cover of Talking Heads’ “Psycho Killer.” And the little girls she raised as Hannah Montana make up the next generation of stars, from Sabrina Carpenter — who at 10 years old won a fan contest to meet Miley — to Chappell Roan, whose fandom of the Disney Channel show inspired her own sparkly alter ego.  

In 2024, Cyrus seems especially at peace, with both her past and who she is now. And after years of the world struggling to catch up to her, it seems the culture – far less uptight than it was when she entered it, thanks in part to her so loudly disavowing the standards of sensibility we used to force on female artists – is finally giving the singer credit for leaving such a lasting impression. 

In an emotional full-circle moment, Cyrus got the rare chance to bask in that recognition at the Disney Legends Ceremony in August. Tearfully facing the crowd with her hair mostly brunette for the first stretch since 2013 – aside from a few streaks of blonde highlight, perhaps showing that all her past selves will always be with her in some capacity – she said that “a little bit of everything has changed” since she first donned her famous wig in 2005. 

“But at the same time, nothing has changed at all,” Cyrus continued. “I stand here still proud to have been Hannah Montana. Because she made Miley in so many ways.” </font></p>
