<center><h1><i>Billboard’s Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century: No. 16 — Jay-Z</i></h1></center>

<p><font size="5">Jay-Z raised the ceiling on hip-hop's impact within 21st century popular music, and proved rappers could be pop stars without ever explicitly going pop.The best is not always the best-selling. Take the Porsche 911: Considered by many experts and fans alike to be pound-for-pound the best sports car money can buy, the rear-engined coupe sells only a fraction of what America’s number one pony car, the Ford Mustang, sells. Despite its motor being in the wrong place, the 911 is thought to be the platonic ideal of a sports car. It can do it all: deliver a transcendent driving experience, win prestigious motor races, do the weekly chore run, ferry a (small) family around, and look cool when parked on the block. Instead of introducing radical new ideas every model year, Porsche has worked to intensely refine and perfect the 911 over the course of its 75-year run.The closest thing hip-hop has to the Porsche 911 is Brooklyn’s own Shawn “Jay-Z” Carter. Throughout his storied three-decade career, Jay-Z never reached the commercial heights of some of his contemporaries but, much like the 911, he represented the platonic ideal of what a rapper should and could be – including as a crossover star, who was able to have major hits and top 40-level success without ever really changing who he was or sounding like he was actively chasing any of it.

Hitting the scene in earnest in 1996 with his debut album Reasonable Doubt, Jay shared underworld tales and street knowledge in a cool unaffected manner that made it seem as if he was letting you in on a secret. With Death Row and Bad Boy dominating the charts in the mid-’90s, Jay worked to carve out a lane for himself as the guy who had one foot on the block and one foot in the boardroom. After not finding high-level commercial success with his debut, Jay recruited the team behind his friend The Notorious B.I.G.’s classic albums to create In My Lifetime, Vol. 1. Debuting at No. 3 on the Billboard 200, Vol. 1. boasted minor hits in “The City Is Mine” and “(Always Be My) Sunshine” but proved that Jay had the propensity to make music that appealed to both radio program directors and true hip-hop heads.

But the real breakthrough came with 1998’s Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life. This time around there was no big-name executive producer, just Jay-Z and his Roc-A-Fella partners Dame Dash and Kareem “Biggs” Burke. The star of the show was the 45 King-produced, Annie-sampling “Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)” that peaked at No. 15 on the Hot 100, becoming Jay-Z’s biggest hit up until that point and pushing Vol 2. to be Jay’s first No. 1 debut on the Billboard 200. Suddenly the hustler from Marcy Projects was no longer toiling away in the shadow of NYC’s towering MCs — he was now one of its brightest stars. Over the next four years Jay-Z proved success does indeed beget success. He launched the careers of a few successful rap stars under his Roc-A-Fella imprint and stretched his earning potential with new clothing and liquor endeavors. But despite all that — as well as a bevy of rap hits and back-to-back Billboard 200 No. 1 albums — Jay’s best days were still far ahead of him. </font> </p>

<center><h1><i>Billboard’s Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century: No. 17 — Shakira</i></h1></center>

<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\17_Shakira_embed_hero-greatest-pop-stars-billboard-1548.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center><br>

<li><font size="5">Born:Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll · 2 February 1977 · Barranquilla, Colombia </li>
<li>Children:2 </li>
<li>Labels:Columbia · Epic · RCA · Sony Latin </li>
<li>Occupations:Singer · songwriter · record producer · dancer · actress · philanthropist</font> </li>

<p><font size="5">Shakira's singular artistry and near-peerless career longevity helped break barriers in pop music throughout the past quarter century.At the dawn of the 21st century, Shakira not only emerged as a global musical force, but reshaped how Latin artists crossed into the mainstream, and thrived there. As the millennium turned, the concept of a Latin pop artist dominating worldwide charts in two languages was more aspirational than realistic. This was despite some crossover successes seen in the late ’90s — artists like Jennifer Lopez sang primarily in English, and only a few, such as Selena and Ricky Martin, made significant impacts while performing extensively in Spanish. Yet, Shakira artfully bridged this gap: Blending her Colombian roots with a sharp pop sensibility, she broke through linguistic barriers and set the stage for the breakthroughs enjoyed by non-English speaking artists to follow. Today, the 15-time Latin Grammy winner is widely considered the most successful female Latin artist of all time, with 95 million records sold over her three-­decade career. Many of her songs have become more than hits, but rather pivotal cultural moments that showcase her as a multidimensional superstar. From the Hot 100 No. 1 juggernaut “Hips Don’t Lie” to the FIFA World Cup banger “Waka Waka” and the unapologetic diss track “Shakira: BZRP Music Sessions, Vol. 53” with Bizarrap – released, respectively, across the first three decades of the 21st century – her tracks have become staples at global gatherings, turning sports anthems into pop phenomena and solidifying her status as an international music ambassador.

Fresh off conquering Latin America with her wildly successful third and fourth studio albums — 1995’s Pies Descalzos and 1998’s Dónde Están Los Ladrones? — Shakira, a belly-dancing, guitar-playing, drum-pounding singer/songwriter, transformed her image and sound to kick off the new millennium. Trading her rockera brunette locks for a sexy blonde look, she set her eyes on the English-language market and released the groundbreaking Laundry Service in November 2001. Propelled by timeless hits like “Whenever, Wherever” and “Underneath Your Clothes,” which climbed to No. 6 and No. 9 on the Hot 100, respectively — the album reached a No. 3 peak on the Billboard 200. <br>

The LP was both a commercial triumph and a cultural milestone for Latin pop.In the peak teen-pop era of TRL, Shakira distinctively carved out her niche as an alternative-leaning pop artist — complete with dirty blonde hair with occasional black streaks and braids, and a hippie-rocker look. An exceptional dancer and multi-instrumentalist with a genuine rock edge, she also stood out as a songwriter who uniquely adapted her lyrical style to English — a language she had only recently learned. Her instantly recognizable voice carried a deep, powerful tone laden with emotional cries, reminiscent of Mercedes Sosa’s depth and Alanis Morissette’s raw energy. Yet, it was entirely her own, and her combination of talents and novel approach made Shakira a unique presence in early 2000s pop, challenging conventional norms and paving a new path towards stardom.</font></p>

<center><h1><i>Billboard’s Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century: No. 18 — The Weeknd</i></h1></center>

<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\18_The-Weeknd_embed_hero-greatest-pop-stars-billboard-1548.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center><br>

<li><font size="5">Born:Abel Makkonen Tesfaye · February 16, 1990 · Toronto, Ontario, Canada </li>
<li>Instruments:Vocals · keyboards</li>
<li>Labels:XO · Republic</li>
<li>Occupations:Singer-songwriter · record producer · actor · businessman</font></li>

<p><font size="5">Born Abel Tesfaye to Ethiopian immigrant parents in the Toronto suburb of Scarborough, The Weeknd dropped out of high school at 17 with his best friend and now creative director La Mar Taylor and moved out of his family’s home one weekend (wink wink). Homelessness, substance abuse and run-ins with the law forced him to get his act together, so he translated the ill-advised lifestyle of his youth to his music.  

In 2010, The Weeknd anonymously uploaded three moody, atmospheric R&B tracks – “What You Need,” “Loft Music” and “The Morning” – onto his YouTube. Fellow Torontonian (and then rap’s brightest budding star) Drake noticed the songs and featured them on his OVO Blog – a key co-sign that projected The Weeknd’s name (and still not his face) in the media before he dropped his debut mixtape House of Balloons for free on his website in March 2011. The songs stretched for five, six, even seven minutes, with The Weeknd’s wailing falsetto and supple tenor from the Michael Jackson vocal academy reliving his pill-popping and bed-hopping escapades and other foggy morning-after memories, through the perspective of someone who’s perpetually attempting to replace his pain with pleasure in a numbing rinse-and-repeat cycle.

Meanwhile, his sampling of indie and post-punk rock bands like Siouxsie & the Banshees, Cocteau Twins and Beach House, along with other hip-hop and electronic influences, forever shifted the R&B landscape — and helped usher the genre’s alternative shift, alongside other enigmatic artists like Frank Ocean. And when it was finally time to reveal himself at his now-iconic debut concert at Toronto’s 600-capacity Mod Club in July 2011, it was the must-see show of the city: The promotional flyer indicated there was “no guestlist,” but that didn’t stop major U.S. label executives from catching last-minute flights up north to see what the hell The Weeknd was even about and if he lived up to the internet hype. (A former MuchMusic employee tells me she remembers one even offering her $1300 CAD for her ticket that she bought for $20.)  

Later that same year, he released two more mixtapes –Thursday and Echoes of Silence – that invited us to venture deeper into The Weeknd’s world of debauchery and self-destruction. With his cult-classic trilogy, The Weeknd firmly established himself as lord of the R&B underworld. In the four-month period between the latter two tapes, he was also all over Drake’s emo magnum opus Take Care, co-writing five songs and being featured on the chant-along banger “Crew Love.” The kinship between the two Canadian phenoms generated a lot of speculation that Drake would sign The Weeknd to OVO, but he continued carving out his own lane, and founded his XO label (fans have debated on Reddit threads whether it stands for “hugs and kisses” or “ecstasy and oxycontin”), signing to Republic Records the following year. Given The Weeknd’s “I thank God that I never signed my life away” line from Future and Metro Boomin’s “All to Myself” during 2024’s Great Rap Beef™, it’s safe to say he believes he made the right decision there.  



<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\18_The-Weeknd_embed_1-greatest-pop-stars-billboard-1240.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center><br>



Tesfaye had steadily built up momentum for his major label debut studio album Kiss Land in 2013, but takeoff there was a bit turbulent. It sounded like he had exhausted his nihilistic, narcotic-fueled aesthetic – and having already consumed what felt like three albums in under one calendar year, we were kind of exhausted, too. Maybe why Kiss Land fell a bit flat was because the air of mystery behind The Weeknd was also fading, especially with his face and Jean-Michel Basquiat-esque dreads front and center on the album cover. Even though Kiss Land entered the Billboard 200 at No. 2, it wasn’t the optimal introduction for an artist who had been cranked out of the internet hype machine – and it received mixed reviews, while failing to produce a hit single. 

But the false start didn’t stop Tesfaye from building a bigger breakout moment. Ariana Grande, the Nickelodeon-bred pop princess who signed to Republic the year before The Weeknd, recruited him for her My Everything single “Love Me Harder.” The lip-biting ruminations about rough sex gave Grande more edge, while the song’s throbbing synthwave-R&B production – courtesy of 21st century-defining producer Max Martin (who would go on to play a crucial role in Tesfaye’s career) – softened The Weeknd’s. It’s the first song to affirm his mainstream ambitions, as Tesfaye earned his first Billboard Hot 100 top 10 hit. Grande would go on to become one of his most reliable hit collaborators a decade later, hopping on the remixes of “Save Your Tears” from his 2020 album After Hours, which they performed together at the 2021 iHeartRadio Music Awards, and “Die For You” – which experienced a TikTok resurgence six-plus years after it first appeared on his Starboy album – both of whichwould then shoot to No. 1.</font></p>

<center><h1><i>Billboard’s Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century: No. 19 — BTS</i></h1></center>

<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\19_BTS_embed_hero-greatest-pop-star-billboard-1548.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center><br>

<li><font size="5">Members:Rm, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, Jungkook</li>
<li>Main Music Genre:K-Pop, hip hop, R&B, EDM, rock</li>
<li>Label Company:Big Hit Entertainment</font></li>

<p><font size="5">When you think of what it takes for a group to become pop stars, imagine having seven individual talents who can each do it all well: sing, rap, dance, and amass a love and fandom that even some of the biggest pop stars could only dream of. That’s what you have with BTS, who crashed through every door of what it takes to be a successful pop act and expanded that with a scope never quite seen before. The group has broken through ceilings for boy bands, K-pop and South Korean artists in general, all while creating a meaningful community that is continually inspired by BTS’ message of positivity, love and connection. 

The global sensations have amassed Beatles-sized success and have become the new blueprint for everything pop: When it comes to maintaining fan hysteria and consistent hitmaking, they are it. In the U.S. alone, the K-pop septet has notched six Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hits and six Billboard 200 No. 1 albums. And as solo artists over the past few years, they’ve all individually created their own lane, and grabbed historic accolades of their own along the way. 

<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\19_BTS_embed_1_REV-greatest-pop-stars-billboard-v3-1240.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center><br>

It all started in 2013, when BTS (short for the Korean phrase Bangtan Sonyeondan, which translates to “Bulletproof Boy Scouts”) was created by Big Hit Entertainment. The group, comprised of RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jung Kook, released the debut EP 2 Cool 4 Skool in June 2013. 

In Korea, BTS was not instantly welcomed. In the band’s biography Beyond the Story, the members speak on the highly competitive genre, and being shunned by peers in the industry, and even by some fans of K-pop. But through the style of vlogging, BTS was able to create a more unique relationship with their fans. Want to hang out and cook along with BTS? You could. That was something that was far from the extremely polished K-pop norms. 

<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\19_BTS_embed_4-greatest-pop-star-billboard-1240.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center><br>

Though BTS was not the first K-pop group to find huge success at home and abroad — and won’t be the last — throughout the group’s journey to global superstardom, there were numerous things that made it special. 

The massive fan group ARMY (Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth) has been with the septet every step of the way. In the 2021 hit “Butter,” the group’s leader RM confidently says, “got ARMY right behind us when we say so.” BTS has over 75 million followers on Instagram and over 48 million followers on X (formerly Twitter). It has grown the group past what people normally see in boy band fandoms: ARMY boosts a diverse community of all ages, races, religions and beyond.
One of the top qualities that makes BTS stand out as pop stars is the members’ ability to bend and blend genres. This is largely due to the group being comprised of different members cast in different roles — K-pop groups will often split different members into a rap line, vocal line, and dance line — giving everybody the ability to shine. They all have their own styles and voices, yet they all blend well together. This individual uniqueness has even led fans to celebrate their “bias” as they connect with their favorite member of the OT7 (One True 7).

Being trained in the K-pop methodology prepared all seven to be strong in all areas of performance. To get to know them as great singers, take note of V’s chilling vocals on “Spring Day,” Jimin’s sweet sensuality on “Serendipity,” Jin’s flawless belting on “Let Go,” or Jung Kook’s effortless falsetto on “Euphoria”. The group’s earliest music was also heavily influenced by hip-hop — and members Suga, RM, and J-Hope’s inspiration from the American hip-hop scene and the underground culture in Korea heavily shaped BTS’ sound. By 2018, Nicki Minaj was even joining the group for an iconic verse on the Love Yourself: Answer single “IDOL”. </font> </p>

<center><h1><i>Billboard’s Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century: No. 20 — Bruno Mars</i></h1></center>

<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\20_Bruno-Mars_embed_hero-billboard-1548.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center><br>

<li><font size="5">Born:Peter Gene Hernandez · October 8, 1985 · Honolulu, Hawaii, U.S.</li>
<li>Instruments:Vocals · guitar · piano · keyboards · drums · bass · ukulele · congas</li>
<li>Labels:Universal Motown · Atlantic · Elektra</li>
<li>Formerly ofThe Smeezingtons</font></li>


<p><font size="5">Born Peter Gene Hernandez – “Bruno” comes from a childhood nickname and “Mars” is because he’s “out of this world,” and wouldn’t you agree? — and hailing from Hawai’i, Mars grew up in a family of musicians and began his performance career at the ripe age of four years old. That Mars got his start performing in his family’s band, The Love Notes, and developed an early reputation as his Hawai’i’s own Little Elvis is nothing short of cosmically poetic given how his career and positioning in the American pop ecosystem is informed by that of both Elvis and Michael Jackson. 

After four years of false starts with a failed label deal and a slow-burner of a publishing deal, Mars began to hit his stride in 2008. By then, Mars had cracked the code of his personal twist on pop songwriting in collaboration with Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine, collectively known as The Smeezingtons: explorations of love and pain rooted in grand, sweeping metaphors and live instrumentation steeped in cross-genre ‘80s influences. Just two months into 2009, Mars netted his breakthrough hit as a songwriter: Flo Rida and Kesha’s 2009 Billboard Hot 100-topper “Right Round.”  

<center><a href="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\watch (4).htm">Click here to watch this song<a></center><br> 


That anthem arrived in the first month of the last year of the ‘00s decade, and Mars quickly followed it up with a pair of tracks – K’Naan’s “Wavin’ Flag,” Coca-Cola’s 2010 FIFA World Cup anthem, and Sugababes’ “Get Sexy” — that both hit No. 2 in the U.K. the following year. Recognized and respected for his songwriting chops, Mars closed out 2009 with the release of the song that would launch him into pop’s mainstream as a vocalist and artist in his own right: B.o.B.’s bubbly Hot 100-topping “Nothin’ On You.” <br>
Positioned as the lead single from B.o.B.’s — then a buzzy Blog Era emcee – major label debut LP, “Nothin’ on You” still stands an era-defining rap&B love ballad, and its success foretold the hip-hop collaboration template Mars would return to throughout his navigation of Top 40’s zenith. Mars would release another pop-rap collab — “Billionaire” (with Travie McCoy) just three months later, earning him another Hot 100 top five hit (No. 4) and more good will with Top 40 radio, while helping usher in 2010s social media’s obsession with speaking things into existence.  

Two months after “Nothin’ on You” topped the Hot 100 in May 2010, Mars properly launched his recording career with “Just the Way You Are,” his debut solo single and lead single from his career-launching Doo-Wops & Hooligans LP. Although some critics initially discounted the song’s sappy lyrics, “Just the Way You Are” eventually became Mars’ first solo Hot 100 chart-topper and earned him his first Grammy, for best male pop vocal performance. That sappiness – which is often just a dual heavy-handed dose of earnestness and appreciation for eras of pop music’s past – is what drew listeners to Mars’ heart-on-your-sleeve anthems throughout the 2010s, especially as the decade began its descent into the kind of cynicism that now derides such displays of ardor. 



<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\20_Bruno-Mars_embed_1-billboard-1240.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center><br>


Doo-Wops & Hooligans peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and has since spent nearly 700 weeks on the ranking. In addition to “Just the Way You Are,” the set also spawned the No. 1 hit “Grenade,” while third single “The Lazy Song” hit No. 4. Doo-Wops, a whimsical debut that melded Mars’ love of R&B and reggae with his pop appeal, found Mars taking his trademark tenor to soaring new heights, delivering feel-good anthems and love-proclaiming power ballads in one fell swoop. The spirit of Elvis shined through his look – hipster era fedora-toting artsy guy who occasionally sports a pompadour-inspired haircut – and his stage show.  



<center><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Randi html\20_Bruno-Mars_embed_2-billboard-1240.webp"width="400"height="400"border="2"></center><br>

Mars’ music didn’t yet call for the physicality of funk, so he found a sweet medium playing a coy multi-instrumentalist heartthrob who wasn’t afraid to bust out a few hip thrusts to get some pulses racing. His debut LP was the kind of smash album that spun gold out of deep cuts: Though they weren’t officially promoted as U.S. radio singles, you’d be hard pressed to find an American over the age of 15 who doesn’t know “Runaway Baby,” “Count on Me” or “Marry You.” Even “Talking to the Moon” got an unexpected TikTok-led resurgence in 2021. 

Though Mars went straight for pop music’s zeitgeist with Doo-Wops, he always kept several toes in the worlds of hip-hop and R&B. For one of the tours he went on to promote the album, he co-headlined a 29-date joint trek with Janelle Monáe — who also released her debut LP in 2010, cementing herself and Mars as the decade’s mainstream torchbearers of funk. In 2011, the year between his debut and sophomore efforts, Mars also scored three consecutive Hot 100 top 20 hits alongside rappers: Bad Meets Evil’s “Lighters” (No. 4), Lil Wayne’s “Mirror” (No. 16) and Snoop Dogg & Wiz Khalifa’s “Young, Wild & Free” (No. 7).</font></p>
